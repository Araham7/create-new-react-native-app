# How to Create a React Native App Using Expo

## Step 1: Open the Terminal and Run the Following Command

```bash
npx create-expo-app araham-native-app --template blank
```
This command initializes a new Expo project named `araham-native-app` with a `blank template`.

## Step 2: Navigate into Your Project Directory
Once the project is created, navigate into the new directory:

```bash
cd araham-native-app
```

## Step 3: Start the Expo Development Server

To start your app, run:

```bash
npx expo start
```
This command opens the Expo Developer Tools in terminal and generate QR-code and link , from which you can manage and test your app on an Android or iOS device.

## Step 4: Running on a Physical Device
To run the app on your phone:
- Install the [Expo Go app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&pcampaignid=web_share) from the `App Store (iOS)` or `Google Play Store (Android)`.
- Open `Expo Go` application and `scan the QR code` shown in the `terminal or browser`.

## Step 5: Edit Your App
Start editing `App.js` to make changes to your app. The app will automatically reload with every saved change.

That's it! You've successfully created a React Native app using Expo.
